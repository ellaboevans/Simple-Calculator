# Simple Calculator App 

This is a simple calculator app designed and programmed by me. So I took this challenge upon myslef to help me improve my coding skills by building realistic projects.


## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- JavaScript



### What I learned

1. How to practically use the arrow callback function.
2. How to pass an empty strings to modify an element on the DOM
3. Learnt that HTML Special Characters cannot be used for such project.


### Continued development

I will continue to build more complex project to enhance my tech stack.
